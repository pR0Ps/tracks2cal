OAuth
=====

This project uses OAuth to connect to Google

`client_secrets.json` is used for storing OAuth information

Until I figure out a way to properly distribute this data, it won't be included in the repository.

Running the Script
==================

1.  Register for API access at `https://code.google.com/apis/console` and download the `client_secrets.json` file into the repository.
2.  Activate the virtual environment.
3.  Optional - Open the script and modify the `folder_name` and `cal_name` parameters to suit your setup.
4.  Run the script.
5.  Authorize the project to access your Google Drive and Google Calender.
6.  Wait for all the KML files to be parsed and added to your calendar.
